This is an example of Pandas chaining using lambda functions

This notebook is an example of Pandas chaining using lambda functions that I made to tweak a blockchain csv output for tax purposes.  This style of coding in pandas avoids the setting with copy warning, cuts down on memory usage by not assigning intermediate variables and is easily reproducable with one funtion call.
